# Driving experience update

The two selectable environments now have separate authored spline routes. Bay uses long coastal sweeps and a lighthouse landmark; Jade Citadel uses tighter courtyard turns, greater elevation variation and smoothly narrowed gate approaches. The road, ramps, collision boundaries, AI and map all use the selected route. Changing environment reloads the scene to release the previous GPU resources.

Vehicles, helmet details, clustered rounded trees and softened rock geometry share a polished toy racing direction. Road surfaces now receive standard lighting and nearby directional shadows in Quality mode. Environment reflections support the vehicles' metal and paint. Performance mode disables dynamic shadows. Citadel combines cool distant mountains with warm lantern lights.

## Controls and teaching

The rule is **charge a drift → release → press E / MINI during the window**. Releasing by itself never applies acceleration. Exit, cut, air and landing boosts retain their existing brief windows. Cyan sparks indicate a charged drift, gold indicates a stronger charge; miniature boosts use warm exhaust and nitro uses blue. Camera widening differs for nitro and miniature boosts, and Reduced camera motion removes it. Drift sparks take priority over exhaust particles while sliding.

A first launch offers an interactive, skippable practice session; it can be replayed from the lobby or settings. Four steps require actual steering, slowing from over 100 internal speed to under 90 with the brake, reaching drift charge, and successfully firing a boost. Practice has no rivals, a speed cap and recovery within the initial safe section. Successful completion starts a formal race. After 55 seconds it pauses with retry/skip, rather than awarding completion. Skipping is remembered on this device.

Beginner assists lower maximum speed/acceleration and smooth deliberate steering. AI target speeds are also lowered in this mode to retain a reachable finish window. Releasing steering still preserves world heading. There is no route-following controller in production. Standard mode uses the existing handling. Turn warnings are shown when assistance is enabled.

## Interface and tactics

Chinese and English are selectable in settings and remembered locally. The first default follows browser language. Racing prioritizes road visibility, position and boost readiness. Full standings and long help are kept out of the active racing HUD; pause contains the control rules. Nearby labels are limited to three non-overlapping labels and distinguish teammates from opponents.

EMP uses an actual 150-world-unit radius, excludes teammates, consumes charge and has a 5-second cooldown. A subtle range circle appears with valid targets, then pulses on activation; the HUD reports target count, hit count and cooldown. AI rivals are slowed for 1.1 seconds by a successful hit. Team scores remain visible. Phone EMP availability follows the same cooldown as the keyboard.

## Practice goals and sound

Best laps, six sector splits and 10 Hz ghost samples are stored separately by route, vehicle and assisted/standard mode. Recovery invalidates the current lap record. Ghost playback is optional, interpolated, non-colliding and ends at its recorded duration. Records stay on the device; no account or server is required.

- Bronze: finish the race.
- Silver: finish with at most three collisions.
- Gold: meet Silver and complete at least six charged drifts and six mini boosts.

Bronze unlocks a gold livery in solo mode. Team colors take priority. Results include collision, drift and boost totals plus average recovery time when recorded.

Original synthesized music, engine/tyre audio and prompt sounds have separate volume controls. Engine pitch follows speed/gear bands; tyre noise follows sliding. Boost-ready, miniature boost, nitro and boost-end cues differ. The music speeds up on the final lap. Audio starts only after a user gesture.

## Validation and remaining evaluation

43 automated tests cover existing manual steering, recovery and mobile sensor isolation plus teaching, records, medals, ghosts, EMP and the two route layouts. A test-only controller completes both full splines and checks for persistent wall contact; it is never imported by the game. Browser checks covered Chinese lobby/settings, teaching entry/skip, pause help, both routes, desktop rendering, and landscape layout; no rendering errors were reported in those checks.

These checks do not establish first-time human corner success, real-phone frame rates/gyro behavior, or a complete subjective audio mix assessment. Those require hands-on playtesting. Full keyboard completion of the tutorial and multiple full races in a real browser remain manual acceptance checks; pure teaching transitions and both full route traversals are automated.

## Club garage lobby

The homepage now uses a physical maintenance bay with a rolling door, tool chest, tire stacks, overhead lighting and a raised maintenance platform. A wide desktop layout separates the primary vehicle, six-car collection strip and compact race console. Phone layouts use a horizontally scrollable collection and fixed launch button; landscape phones retain a side console.

Car thumbnails render the actual models using the existing WebGL renderer. The selected track gets a live scene thumbnail; previously visited tracks use their cached thumbnails and unvisited tracks show their authored route outline. Car/team/mode choices survive scene changes. Vehicle titles, local medal and selected-car best lap are reflected in the lobby. Entry, selection and a short shutter/camera launch transition respect Reduced camera motion.

Browser validation covered desktop 1280×800, portrait 390×844 and landscape 844×390, model selection, race launch, scene switching and preview-to-scene correspondence. These are browser layout checks, not physical phone performance measurements.

## Custom keyboard controls

PC defaults now follow a two-hand kart layout: arrows drive, Shift drifts, Ctrl fires nitro, W triggers a ready mini/air/landing boost, Q fires EMP, H pauses and R restarts. A/D/S remain fallback steering/brake keys unless explicitly rebound. Space is unassigned by default. Tap and release Ctrl before W to avoid browser Ctrl+W shortcuts. Command/Alt shortcuts are not consumed. Esc always pauses/resumes.

Settings → Controls offers ten remappable actions, duplicate-key validation, Esc cancellation, automatic local saving and a restore-default button. Letters, numbers, arrows, Space, Shift and Ctrl are supported; both physical sides of Shift/Ctrl share a binding. Help, race hints and lesson instructions use the saved keys. Touch actions and gyro eligibility remain independent.

Validation: 49 tests including countdown input, held-key release, alias overlap, modifier normalization, preset separation, persistence validation and translated hints. Desktop browser verified conflict rejection, remapping, cancellation, persistence, remapped pause and live help. Physical keyboard rollover varies by hardware; no claim of testing every keyboard or operating-system shortcut combination.

## In-page map switching

Map selection swaps cached route geometry in the existing renderer instead of navigating/reloading the document. Track meshes, decorations, gate layout, collision samples, pickup positions, minimap and record context change together. The garage, selected kart/team, settings and lobby scroll remain in place. Only Bay and Citadel are cached; revisiting a map reuses its assets and preview. URL history supports Back/Forward, including cancelling a pending launch before switching back.

Validation: desktop and 390 × 844 browser checks for repeated Bay/Citadel selection, retained car/team and lobby state, Back navigation and actual Citadel race launch. Three route-switch regression tests cover cache reuse, inactive visibility, geometry/URL updates and race/launch guards. No physical-phone memory or GPU benchmark was performed.

## Vehicle surface and geometry refinement

All six karts share clearer paint/metal/rubber/seat/visor material separation and a multi-panel reflection environment. The five road-kart variants now have a tapered nose, distinct lower splitter and side pods, open cockpit, upholstered seat and harness, deeper rims, brake rotors, stationary calipers and tire grooves. Wheel assemblies rotate around the axle together, while calipers stay attached to the steering hub. Repeated spokes, bolts and tread details use instancing. The showroom frames smaller road karts more closely.

TITAN keeps turquoise armor with team-colored trim. It adds layered rear fender panels, deeper projector headlights, rounded tire sidewalls, recessed brakes and rim lips, exhaust collars and a rear diffuser. Garage finish controls target explicit body-paint metadata rather than a fragile roughness value. The GLB exporter resolves the shared finish module and remains usable.

Validation: 52 existing regression tests passed. Static build and TITAN GLB export passed (about 2.55 MB, finite geometry). Road wheel position/normal buffers were checked for finite values; spokes and bolts render as instances. Desktop visual checks covered TITAN front-quarter/rear/paint switching, APEX showroom and SLIDE race launch; no console errors. Physical-phone frame rate and memory were not benchmarked.

## Full-fleet custom garage

The garage now uses the same six kart models as the lobby and race. Each car saves its own body color, gloss/satin/metallic finish, solid/twin-stripe/checker livery and accent color, plus jet/pulse/off exhaust with a custom flame color. Changes apply live, persist on the current browser/device, and carry into the selected circuit. Reset affects only the current car. Cosmetic choices do not change driving performance. The garage supports a scrollable mobile layout, larger touch targets, camera presets and boost preview.

Validation: 58 automated tests pass, including all-six-car customization, per-car persistence, corrupted/blocked storage fallback, decal replacement/disposal and exhaust reset. Browser checks covered saved configurations after refresh, car switching, paint/exhaust in a running race, and a 390 × 844 mobile viewport.

The workshop now presents cars on a dark illuminated turntable with circular markers and studio light bars. Previous/next controls wrap through all six vehicles; the numbered selector supports keyboard arrows, Home/End and horizontal pointer swipes independently of the 3D orbit canvas. Switching uses a short positional transition and honors reduced-motion preferences. Paint, livery and exhaust are separate keyboard-accessible tabs with visual option cards. Browser verification covered wraparound, swipe selection at 390 × 844, keyboard tab navigation, saved configuration after reload and exhaust preview; all 58 existing tests pass.

## Language selection

New visitors default to English regardless of browser locale. EN / 中文 controls in the lobby and garage synchronize with the existing settings selector. Language choices persist on the current device and synchronize between tabs; translation updates in place without reloading the page. English source text is retained for switching back, including dynamic vehicle labels. Storage failures still allow session-only selection. Verified in desktop and 390 × 844 mobile layouts, with persistence after reload and cross-page navigation. All 62 tests pass, including default-language, persistence, dynamic-label and storage-failure checks.
